>
> * Because you want to write Wiki pages on GitHub,  
> but don't know how to start.  
>
> * Because you want to write your markdown code in your local editor, e.g. Vim,  
> but you are missing a preview in your browser.

> #### How the qoolixiloop repositories intend to make his friends productive
> * You will get access to all my README and Wiki markdown files.  
> These web pages will give you a lot of inspiration to become quickly productive.  
>
> * You will get instructions about a local browser preview tool.  
> Its name is Grip, and it allows you to preview your markdown web pages in your browser, before you commit and upload them to GitHub. Because it uses the GitHub API, your preview is close to what you will see, after uploading it to GitHub.

### 🎁 Download my markdown files
> The files of my GitHub repositories are not yet ready to be shared. But there is no need to wait, because I am going to share a trick, about how you can access the source code of any markdown web page on GitHub. By clicking the button below, you will see the three different patterns on how to get access to the raw markdown text files.  
>
> <details>
> <summary> 📖  show the examples </summary>
> 🎁
>   
> 1. **Wiki Home.md:** This is the URL you see, when you visit my Wiki helloworld homepage.  
>        https://<i></i>github.com<i></i>/qoolixiloop/qool-helloworld-loop/wiki  
>
>    * just add '/Home.md' as follows:  
>        https://<i></i>github.com<i></i>/qoolixiloop/qool-helloworld-loop/Wiki/Home.md  
>
>    * and you will be relocated to the following URL, where you can see the markdown source.  
>        https://<i></i>raw.githubusercontent.com<i></i>/wiki/qoolixiloop/qool-helloworld-loop/Home.md  
>
> 2. **Wiki pages:** For all other Wiki pages, it is even simpler, because the name of the file is already part of the URL. You just need to add '.md' at the end.  
>        https://<i></i>github.com<i></i>/qoolixiloop/qool-markdown-loop/wiki/browser-navigation-with-grip-running.md  
>
> 3. **README.md:** If you like to see the markdown source code of this README page, just enter the follwing URL or log into GitHub and click the "raw" button.  
>        https://<i></i>raw.githubusercontent.com<i></i>/qoolixiloop/qool-markdown-loop/master/README.md  
>
> * **On a side note:** Markdown is very easy to use but also rather limited if compaired with HTML. If special effects are needed, HTML tags can be used directly. Usually, that works quite well, but not always. If you want to know how I e.g. managed to make the links unclickable, try out the last trick and look directly into the raw Markdown file.

### 📜 Instructions on how to use the Grip markdown preview (and Vim)
> The reason why I write my code locally with Vim and not directly into the editor on GitHub, is because it is in many respects so much more powerful. I have syntax highlighting, search and replace with regex, folding, macros and much more. The downside is, that I need a local preview tool like Grip. Even thought it parses the code correctly, it doesn't show every object in the same manner like GitHub itself. I assume that is because GitHub is loaded with libraries and CSS classes in order to make the things look even nicer. But this is all right for me, I only need to know, if the API recognizes my table, and if it is even nicer after uploading onto GitHub, that is even better.
> If that is also all right for you, you can click the button below. The steps show, how to install and run Grip and how to open the markdown file in Vim. It's easy, five steps and you can start writing the markdown text for your own repositories. And at the end you will find a link to one of my Wiki pages, which shows a better way, if you have several files in several different folders. (Spoiler alert: open Grip in the parent folder.)

> 📜
>   
>    * Install Grip on Linux Ubuntu with:  
>         $ sudo apt get grip  
>    
>    * Move to your folder containing your md files with:  
>         $ cd /my_md_directory/  
>    
>    * Start Grip with:  
>         $ grip my_md_file.md  
>    
>    * Open your browser and enter following URL:  
>         http://<i></i>localhost:6419<i></i>/my_md_file.md  
>    
>    * Open your file with your prefered editor. For Vim just type:  
>         $ vim my_md_file.md  
>    
>    * That's it! If you like to quit or change your folder just stop the Grip server by pressing:  
>         Ctrl-D  
>
> * Now you can move to another folder containing '.md' files and start Grip again. 
> * If you don't like to restart Grip for each file or folder, you can visit my Wiki page, which describes a [browser navigation alternative for Grip.][1003]

### 🌎 Links
> To share the links of web pages, which present their content in a clear and easy to read manner is one of the main objectives of my repositories. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, because most of the time there are already excellent resources out there, where the reader can find the needed information. But often, even with the help of one's preferred search engine, one ends up spending one's time with searching instead of working.  
> By clicking the button below you will see the links of my top seven sites for markdown on GitHub. If you still struggle with the syntax, then you may consider clicking through any pages on GitHub you like, access their raw markdown text files as described [here][50] and copy/paste whatever you need.

### 🗄️ qoolixiloop's repositories
>
> By clicking the button below you will see a table with links to my 15 Code and 15 Wiki repositories as well as a short description of what is already available. They cover a small subset of programming languages I learned during the last 20 or so years. The focus is mainly on free and open source tools within the linux operating system universe.  
> Because the learning curve for many of those tools and languages I used was steeper than necessary, I decided to provide some of my resources, references and examples, in order to help new learners better understand important topics.  
>
> <details>
> <summary> 📖  list of repositories </summary>

>
> **Tmux and Vim as an IDE:** There are many good development environments availabe and some of them are quite expensive. Nevertheless or because of that, I mainly use Tmux and Vim as they are two very powerful terminal applications, which provide me with everything I need to write code efficiently. That being said, I must admit, that it is not easy to start with. That is why I shared my '.vim' folder and '.vimrc' configuration file, which both contain all the necessary instructions to download the plugins and run Vim within minutes as an IDE for example for Python, Java or Bash.  
>
> **Vim as a language:** Once I started programming with Vim, I immediately came into contact with Vim's own programming language, Vimscript. I even started to write my own little plugins and macros in Vimscript.  
>
> **Web Applications:** Google's Angular2 and the Springboot framework are part of the high demand trendy Java world. We used it at the University to build a multi-player online strategy game, which I intend to share as a tutorial. But that will certainly take some time.  
>
> **C**: Dennis Ritchie the father of Unix also developed C, which was in fact my first programming language. It is very low level compaired to newer languages, like Java or Python, many of which actually are implemented in C. It is clearly part of the low supply world, which means, that even though the language is still very useful for certain tasks, there are not many programmers left, that are able to understand it.  
>
> **Linux Tools:** Bash and AWK are old, but still very powerful languages in the Unix/Linux command line world and even though the Linux kernel itself is written in C, many configuration scripts one may come across are written in Bash.  
> There is already a lot of very good advice about Bash programming available in thick books as well as in form of snippets scattered around specialized blogs and webpages. But it is still hard to get started with. That is why I decided to create a small framework inside a template script, whose code itself is checked by the shellcheck project. The template e.g. contains a few instructions, which make use of a concept used in Python to run the script from within a main() function, which is useful if the script is sourced or executed within another script in order to access its functions.  
> Furthermore, I provided an extensive example script, in which I cover nearly everything one needs to write stable and reliable scripts. I actually use it, to automate my communication with GitHub. It also lets me do changes on all my GitHub files automatically by providing pattern search and replace, and it uses AWK to parse the script and to automatically print help and documentation text into the shell.
